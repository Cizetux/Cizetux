## Profile
Java Junior Developer, I spend lot of time learning this programming language.

## My current projects:
- [Playground](https://github.com/Cizetux/Playground): I'm deepening my knowledge in Java and write funny systems in this project.
- [Rushyverse](https://github.com/Rushyverse): I'm learning Kotlin and add some features in different repositories of this organization. (I'm not attracted with this language now).

## Languages
*Work in Progress...*

## 
See you soon!

Special thanks to @Quentixx AND @Distractic ü§ç
